[tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to) has a lot of [integrations](https://help.tawk.to/category/integrations), but not for Laravel. This is a tawk.to chat widget for Laravel.

## Installation

1. `composer require emotality/tawk-laravel`
2. `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Emotality\TawkTo\TawkToServiceProvider"`
3. Add the following line to your `.env` file:

```
TAWKTO_LINK="<your_direct_chat_link>"
```

*Get your key from the **Direct Chat Link** field from [your dashboard](https://dashboard.tawk.to/#/admin)*

---

Laravel 5.5+ will use the auto-discovery function but for Laravel 5.4 and lower, you will need to include the service provider & facade manually in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...,
    /*
     * Package Service Providers...
     */
    Emotality\TawkTo\TawkToServiceProvider::class,
    ...,
];

...

'aliases' => [
    ...,
    'TawkTo' => Emotality\TawkTo\TawkTo::class,
];
```

## Usage

Just echo the widget code in your app layout blade inside the body tag:

```html
        ...
        {{ TawkTo::widgetCode() }}
    </body>
</html>
```

Or, if you don't want to use a config file, you can set your key directly like this:

```html
        ...
        {{ TawkTo::widgetCode('your_direct_chat_link') }}
    </body>
</html>
```
